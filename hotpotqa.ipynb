Many variants were produced, often under license, which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibres, with 40 calibre the most common.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defence guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.\n",
